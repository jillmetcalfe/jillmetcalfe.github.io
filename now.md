# What I'm Doing Now

*This is a "now page" - inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on right now.*

*Updated June 15th, 2025, from Lausanne, Switzerland*

## Current Focus

### Building This Website
I'm actively building out this Jekyll site on GitHub Pages with help from Anthropic Claude's MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. It's fascinating to work with an AI that can directly make commits and deploy changes - feels like the future of development collaboration. Starting from the minima theme and gradually adding styling elements inspired by the al-folio template.

### Automation & APIs
Getting more comfortable using API modules in my Make.com automations. There's something satisfying about connecting different services and watching data flow between them automatically. Currently exploring ways to streamline repetitive workflows.

### The 30-Year Blog Dream
I finally want to start blogging on jillmetcalfe.com - a domain I've owned for nearly 30 years! It's time to stop overthinking and start writing. Planning to focus on development insights, automation discoveries, and lessons learned from building things.

## Current Projects

### This Portfolio Site
- Migrating from the complex al-folio academic template to a cleaner, professional setup
- Adding project showcases for my development work
- Planning a bookshelf section to share what I'm reading

### Automation Tools
- Building Make.com scenarios that actually solve real problems
- Exploring API integrations for data collection and processing
- Creating tools that eliminate repetitive tasks in my workflow

## What I'm Learning

**Technical Skills**: Deepening my Jekyll knowledge, getting more confident with GitHub MCP integrations, and exploring advanced Make.com automation patterns.

**Industry Trends**: Staying current with web development best practices and watching how AI tools are changing the development landscape.

## What I'm Reading

*Planning to expand this into a proper bookshelf section soon!*

Currently working through technical documentation and development blogs, plus always have a few non-fiction books on rotation.

## What I'm Not Doing

- Not taking on new consulting projects while I focus on building out my own tools and content
- Not getting distracted by every new framework that comes out (though it's tempting!)
- Not letting perfectionism stop me from shipping things

## Recent Highlights

**This Month**: Finally made real progress on this website rebuild, discovered how powerful MCP integrations can be for development workflows.

**This Quarter**: Significantly improved my automation skills, started thinking seriously about content strategy for the blog I've been putting off for decades.
