# The Pragmatic Programmer
**by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt**

**Status:** Currently Reading  
**Started:** June 1, 2025

## Initial Impressions

A classic in software development that I'm finally getting around to reading. The advice feels timeless despite being written years ago - a testament to focusing on fundamental principles rather than specific technologies.

## Notes So Far

**DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system.

**The Broken Window Theory**: Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, poor code) unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it's discovered.

**Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs**: Great metaphors for gradual change in organizations and projects.
